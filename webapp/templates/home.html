        <p>This is an alternate version of the popular Plants vs Zombies game, using python.  
           There are 3 difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard, with the hard difficulty featuring a night-time background.
           Our version features both plants and zombies that didn't make it into the original - check them out on the units page!  
           You can also see your scores on the scoreboard page.

        <h1>What is Plants vs Zombies?</h1>
        <p>Plants vs Zombies, or PvZ for short, is a "tower-defense" game in which the player must defend their home from zombies by placing plants on their lawn.
           These plants can perform a variety of different functions, from shooting projectiles at the zombies to generating gold for more plants or simply obstructing the zombies' paths.
